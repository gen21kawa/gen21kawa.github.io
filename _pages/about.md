I am a PhD student in Bioengineering at Imperial College London, working in the [Be.Neural Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/neural-interfaces/research/be.neural-lab/) under the supervision of Dr. Juan A. Gallego.

My research focuses on computational neuroscience, studying neural dynamics and motor control. I am interested in understanding how the brain controls movement and adapts to changes.

Previously, I worked as a Project Researcher at the University of Tokyo in the Oizumi Lab, where I developed computational frameworks for quantifying brain state transitions and studying the structure of subjective experience using optimal transport methods.

I received my BA in Mathematics from Swarthmore College with minors in Computer Science and Cognitive Science.
